# Electron-React
### An attempt to combine Eel+Electron+React
This is just a proof of concept trying to get Eel, React, and Electron to work together.

Install node modules with the usual:
```
npm install
```

Compile all JSX files in src to plain javascript with:
```
npx babel --watch src --out-dir web/js --presets react-app/prod
```

Open a new terminal and run:
```
python hello.py
```
